The process of hypothesis testing involves setting up two competing hypotheses, the null hypothesis and the alternate hypothesis. One selects a random sample (or multiple samples when there are more comparison groups), computes summary statistics and then assesses the likelihood that the sample data support the research or alternative hypothesis. In other words, a hypothesis test evaluates two mutually exclusive statements about a population to determine which statement is best supported by the sample data.
